## Key decisions still in force

- Single Next.js app (`apps/web`) with role-grouped routes — locked since phase 1.
- Single Supabase project, multi-tenant via RLS on `country_code` JWT claim — locked.
- AMA-mirrored design system in `packages/ui` — locked.
- `country_code` is enum on `user_roles` (auth-side strictness) but `text` on `countries.code` (FK target for leads/callbacks) — accepted asymmetry, see plan 02-01 SUMMARY.
- Migration filenames are sequential `0000N_*.sql`; new plan numbers do NOT correspond to migration numbers. Plan 03-01 took `00009`; plan 03-04 took `00010`. Next migration is `00011`.
- `lead_events.country_code` denormalised from `leads` (deviation from PRD) — symmetric RLS, indexable. Maintained by BEFORE INSERT trigger.
- All Phase 2 + Phase 3 RLS policies use `(SELECT auth.jwt()/auth.uid())` wrap for InitPlan caching. All views set `security_invoker = true`. (Phase 1's `user_roles` policies are unwrapped — small table, low cost; cleanup in Phase 6.)
- Dedupe bucket uses `date_bin('5 minutes', submitted_at, '2000-01-01Z'::timestamptz)` (the IMMUTABLE timestamptz overload), not `date_trunc + extract` — required because the expression sits inside a unique index.
- Realtime uses Broadcast-from-Database (not `postgres_changes`); private channels are auth-checked via 3 RLS policies on `realtime.messages`.
- `ingest_lead(jsonb)` is the single atomic entry point for lead creation; webhook (02-04) and CSV importer (02-05) both wrap it. Service-role only (`REVOKE ALL FROM public/anon/authenticated; GRANT EXECUTE TO service_role`).
- Webhook ingest is HMAC-authenticated, not session-authenticated. Middleware bypasses cookie auth for any `/api/leads/*` path; each route does its own auth (HMAC for the webhook, cookie session for the importer). The redundant per-path `PUBLIC_PATHS` entry that plan 02-04 added was removed in plan 02-06 — single source of truth is now the prefix block.
- `runtime='nodejs'` on the webhook because Edge has no `crypto.timingSafeEqual`.
- `PARATUS_INGEST_SECRET` provisioned in Vercel for prod/preview/dev. Production + Preview are flagged Sensitive; Development is plain (Vercel rejects `--sensitive` on the development target). Same value across all three; rotate together via the runbook in `.planning/phases/02-data-model-ingestion/02-USER-SETUP.md`.
- Path 3 CSV importer (`/api/leads/import-csv`) reuses Phase 1's `createAdminClient` (`@repo/supabase/admin`) instead of plan 02-04's new `createServiceRoleClient` in `server.ts` — same key, same options. Both names exist in the codebase; convergence to one is a small Phase 6 cleanup.
- Integration tests authenticate test users via the magiclink-cookie technique (`admin.generateLink` → `anon.verifyOtp`) — no test passwords in env. Service-role client is setup-only; assertions run from anon-key clients carrying real user JWTs so RLS is the thing under test.
- Realtime tests listen on `event:'*'` not `'INSERT'`. The agent broadcast trigger emits `TG_OP`, and the webhook path triggers an `UPDATE` (assign_lead changes assigned_to from NULL → agent_id) rather than the `INSERT` (which has assigned_to=NULL).
- Phase 3 queue RPCs (`mark_lead_contacted`, `complete_call`, `schedule_callback`, `record_no_answer`, `agent_stats_in_range`) are EXECUTE-granted to `authenticated`, not `service_role` like `ingest_lead`. They run from the agent's authed cookie session, gate `auth.uid() = leads.assigned_to` AND `auth.jwt() ->> country_code = leads.country_code` inside the SECURITY DEFINER function (defence in depth — the definer-rights bypass RLS, so the inside-function check is the only enforcement on writes).
- `agent_today_stats` view: `security_invoker = true`, LEFT JOINed from `user_roles` so every active agent gets a row even with zero work (UI doesn't have to handle missing rows). Plan 03-04 rewrote the column shape to `to_call_count / follow_ups_count / done_today / converted_today / lost_today` (was `to_call_count / completed_today / converted_today / callbacks_pending`).
- Plan 03-01 dropped the `as never` cast on `ingestLead` after regenerating `Database` type against migration 00009 — Phase 2 carry-forward TODO closed.
- Plan 03-02 rewrote `packages/supabase/src/realtime.ts` from a `postgres_changes` subscriber to `usePrivateBroadcast<T>` — a generic private-channel broadcast hook with `config: { private: true }` baked in. Country admin (Phase 4) reuses the same hook with `topic: country:<code>`; agents use the typed `useAgentBroadcast` wrapper at `apps/web/app/(sales-rep)/_components/use-agent-broadcast.ts`.
- Plan 03-02 listens on `event:'*'` (not `INSERT`) because the webhook path always emits `UPDATE` — `assign_lead` flips `assigned_to` from `NULL` to `agent_id` after the initial insert. Filtering to a single op would silently miss the production code path (same call shipped in plan 02-06's broadcast test).
- Plan 03-02 stats are server-authoritative: `getAgentTodayStats()` is fetched on every server render, and the client only optimistically bumps `to_call_count` by 1 on a fresh assignment. Plan 03-04 wires `router.refresh()` after every successful outcome RPC so all five counters re-fetch from the authoritative server view.
- **Plan 03-04 — sales-pipeline jargon collapsed: 5 outcomes → 3 outcomes + soft-no-answer.** UI label "Converted" maps to DB `status='converted'`. The DB enum value `lead_events.outcome='won'` is preserved for analytics back-compat — UI never renders the word "won".
- **Plan 03-04 — `'qualified'` rejected by `complete_call`** (post-00010); status enum still contains it (no destructive change) but no code path emits it. Zod `callOutcomeEnum` and the RPC IF-validation both reject it.
- **Plan 03-04 — no-answer attempts never auto-Lost.** Agent retains the lead forever in Follow-ups; `call_attempts >= 3 AND last_outcome='no_answer'` triggers the tab move only. Status stays `contacted`.
- **Plan 03-04 — date range URL-stateful** via `?range=today|week|month|custom` (+ `?from`/`?to`); server-fetched via `getAgentStatsInRange` RPC. `parseRangeParams` helper at `apps/web/app/(sales-rep)/_lib/date-range.ts` is the single source of truth for both server page and client picker.
- **Plan 03-04 — defence-in-depth on the dead-button bug.** `mark_lead_contacted` RAISEs `invalid_status` when called against a `converted` or `lost` lead; UI hides the button. Two layers must fail to reproduce plan 03-03's dead-button crash.
- **Plan 03-04 — done_today single-counted at the view layer.** Recreated `agent_today_stats.done_today` reads `count(leads where status IN ('converted','lost') and updated_at >= start_of_day)` — no longer sums `lead_events`. Fixes the prior bug where the `'connected'` event leaked into the counter.
- **Plan 03-04 — modal-free surface.** `CallOutcomeModal` deleted from `@repo/ui`. Inline state-aware card actions (`<CardActionArea />`) cover all five outcomes (Call → Converted / Lost / Callback / No-answer). `git grep -n 'CallOutcomeModal' packages/ apps/` returns zero hits.
- **Plan 04-01 — JWT custom claims are `user_role` + `country_code`** (NOT `role`/`country`); the `agent` role enum value is what `user_roles.role` stores (NOT `sales_rep`). Every guard in 00011 reads those exact keys. The 04-01 plan template was written before that convention was finalised; corrected during execution.
- **Plan 04-01 — speed-to-lead asymmetry: median for the sparkline, average for the headline KPI tile.** `speed_to_lead_series` returns P50 + P75 because charts are sensitive to outliers; `country_speed_to_lead_today.avg_response_seconds` keeps "Avg Response Time" on the tile because that's the literal mockup label. Documented in SQL comments.
- **Plan 04-01 — speed-to-lead NULL policy: aggregations operate only over leads where `first_contacted_at IS NOT NULL`.** Including uncontacted leads would make the metric look artificially fast (Phase 4 RESEARCH.md pitfall 3). Applies to `country_speed_to_lead_today` AND `speed_to_lead_series`.
- **Plan 04-01 — `reassign_lead` cross-country target guard is the *only* defence for HQ admins.** Country admins are caught earlier by the JWT-country guard, but hq_admin has no country-scope check. The target-country comparison (`v_target_country IS DISTINCT FROM v_lead_country` → `cross_country_assignment` / 42501) stops cross-country zombie assignments.
- **Plan 04-01 — `agent_performance_in_range.leads_assigned` is range-windowed.** First cut counted lifetime assignments; caught by the zero-work-agent test, fixed in commit `aaba26e` and applied live as patch migration `country_admin_fix_leads_assigned_window`. Source-of-truth `00011_country_admin.sql` carries the corrected version.
- **Plan 04-01 — `status_pipeline_today` includes the full `lead_status` enum, including `qualified`.** Even though Phase 3 plan 03-04 made `complete_call` reject `qualified`, the enum value is preserved for analytics back-compat and the funnel renders five segments (qualified will simply read 0).
- **Plan 04-02 — `status_pipeline_today` view's GROUP BY drops zero-count buckets.** The DAL surface returns *only* statuses with at least one lead today; the consuming `<StatusPipelineCard>` component defaults missing statuses to 0 so the funnel always renders five segments. Test case 3 pins the contract; the DAL doc-comment was refined to spell it out (the prior comment incorrectly claimed "5 rows" which only happens when every status has data).
- **Plan 04-02 — Recharts `^3.8.1` pinned to AMA companion repo, `apps/web`-only install (not monorepo root).** `@types/recharts` deliberately not installed (Recharts ships its own; the legacy types package is years out of date).
- **Plan 04-02 — country broadcast topic `country:<code>` listening on `event:'*'`.** Same reasoning as plan 03-02 — the webhook path emits `UPDATE` (when `assign_lead` flips `assigned_to` from `NULL` to `agent_id`); filtering to a single op would silently miss the production code path. The country-scope realtime broadcast triggers from `00008_realtime_broadcast.sql` already exist; no new DB work needed.
- **Plan 04-02 — two-source stats split is now also the country-admin pattern.** `KpiStrip` reads `country_today_stats` for live tiles + delta + `country_stats_in_range` for the range-aware Converted tile; `<StatusPipelineCard>` and `<LeadsByServiceCard>` are today-only views. Same shape Phase 3 locked for the agent queue. `router.refresh()` will resync the server view on every successful write later in 04-03.
- **Plan 04-02 — speed-to-lead chart `<ReferenceLine y={300} />`, not `y=5`.** The DB stores `extract(epoch from ...)` — seconds, not minutes. 300 seconds = the 5-minute target. Documented in the chart file.
- **Plan 04-02 — custom 160×160 SVG gauge ring, no library.** ~12 lines of `<circle stroke-dasharray>` math is lighter than any gauge library. Recharts is reserved for the AreaChart sparkline only (gradient fill, `<ReferenceLine>`, monotone curve).
- **Plan 04-02 — 04-04 visual checkpoint inputs explicitly logged.** Three known visual deferrals — pixel-perfect spacing review, broadcast-bump delta-colour transitions (currently jumps; 04-04 may add 200ms ease), gauge ring stroke-linecap (currently `butt`; mockup has `round`) — are listed in the SUMMARY's "Visual fidelity" section so 04-04 picks them up rather than silently leaving them as tech debt.
- **Plan 04-01 — `country_speed_to_lead_today` coexists with `speed_to_lead_daily` (00006).** Different shapes (today single-row vs per-day), both kept. The today view powers the gauge tile; the daily view powers the multi-day chart.
- **Plan 04-03 — CSV export uses cookie-authed `createClient`, never service-role** (RESEARCH.md pitfall 6). RLS is the country lock; HQ admins see all because the JWT custom claim doesn't pin `country_code`. The route deliberately does NOT add an `.eq("country_code", ...)` filter — that would silently break HQ's see-all path and is dead-code for country admins (RLS already enforces it).
- **Plan 04-03 — defence-in-depth role gate on both country-admin routes.** `claims.user_role` checked at the route layer (`country_admin | hq_admin`) on top of the SECURITY DEFINER `forbidden_role` guard inside `reassign_lead`. Mirrors the agent queue routes (`/api/queue/complete` etc.). 401 for missing session, 403 for wrong role.
- **Plan 04-03 — offset pagination for the lead list, cursor migration deferred to Phase 6.** Paratus's largest active country has ~5k leads; offset works at this scale. No `// TODO` left in code (Boil-the-Ocean) — v1 code is correct as shipped, just not asymptotically optimal.
- **Plan 04-03 — no realtime broadcast on the lead list view.** Pagination + concurrent inserts shifts indices; admins on page 2 would see rows duplicate / disappear as new leads arrive on page 1. Overview tiles still pop via `useCountryBroadcast`. Verified: opening `/[country]/leads` does NOT open a Supabase realtime WS connection.
- **Plan 04-03 — cross-country reassignment guard is RPC-only.** No client-side check in `<ReassignDialog>` — the agents dropdown is already filtered to the lead's country (`getCountryAgents(country)`), and the RPC's `cross_country_assignment` guard backstops it. Single source of truth at the SQL layer; UI layer doesn't try to mirror the rule.
- **Plan 04-03 — `q` filter sanitises `,()` before PostgREST `.or()`.** supabase-js splits the `.or()` value on commas and parens; passing user input verbatim breaks the filter. Helper strips those characters (searching for them isn't meaningful for name/email/phone).
- **Plan 04-03 — `signInViaBridge` collects every `Set-Cookie` chunk** via `getSetCookie()`. Next sets multiple `sb-...-auth-token.{0,1,...}` chunks for big sessions; concatenating only the first one breaks RLS auth in the test client. Helper splits each chunk on `;`, takes the `name=value` head, and joins with `; ` for the request `Cookie:` header.
- **Plan 04-04 — migration 00012 (`user_roles` country-admin SELECT) authorised at the visual checkpoint.** Phase 1 only allowed HQ admins to read all rows + users to read their own row. Country admins' UI display paths that read `user_roles` (reassign dropdown + lead-list "Assigned To" cell) silently degraded to "no agents" / "Unassigned" because `getCountryAgents()` returned the empty set under their seat. Writes remain HQ-only via the existing `HQ admins manage user_roles` policy. The `reassign_lead` RPC's `SECURITY DEFINER` body is unaffected (it bypasses RLS) — the route-layer reassign always worked; only the UI display paths were broken.
- **Plan 04-04 — cross-dashboard congruence wins over mockup literalism.** When a shipped neighbour (Phase 3 queue-stats) and a Phase 4 mockup disagree on a visual pattern, the neighbour wins. The Phase 4 KPI strip was refactored from "small inset accent stripe at top of card" (mockup) to "ring around card matching the tile's domain colour with the number coloured to match" (queue-stats). HQ overview (Phase 5) inherits the same pattern.
- **Plan 04-04 — pipeline funnel widths are positional, not data-driven.** `<StatusPipelineCard>` renders fixed widths `100/88/76/64/52` so it always reads as a coherent funnel even when downstream segments are zero. Counts + share-% inside each segment carry the data; width is a visual cue. Resolves a checkpoint finding where the prior data-driven width formula collapsed sparse-data segments to a 25% min that looked stacked.
- **Plan 04-04 — three stat-tile patterns now exist** (`MetricCard` in `@repo/ui` with full-width top bar, `queue-stats` with coloured ring, `kpi-strip` now also coloured ring). Phase 6 cleanup target: consolidate to a single shared component.
- **Plan 05-01 — `leads_by_service_group` is ALL-TIME, diverging from `leads_by_service_today` (00011, today-only per country).** Mockup math has the bars summing to "Total Leads (Group)" 8,432; today-only would break the visual contract. Documented in SQL COMMENT and migration header.
- **Plan 05-01 — `group_today_stats` body uses two CTEs cross-joined** (`country_aggs` summing per-country `country_today_stats`, `leads_aggs` aggregating from raw `leads`). Avoids the cartesian double-count that would occur if `countries ⨯ country_today_stats ⨯ leads` were joined in a single FROM clause.
- **Plan 05-01 — `group_speed_to_lead_series` uses UTC day boundaries (not country tz).** Group view spans 12 IANA tz; per-country boundary makes no sense in a single-axis trend. Country-scoped `speed_to_lead_series` (00011) keeps country-tz boundaries because it's scoped.
- **Plan 05-01 — `group_speed_to_lead_series` rejects `country_admin` (`forbidden_role / 42501`).** Country admins have their own per-country RPC (00011); the HQ RPC is HQ-only by design, not a wider window of theirs.
- **Plan 05-01 — `country_performance_today.avg_response_seconds` is ALL-TIME.** Today-only would be too volatile across small-volume countries.
- **Plan 05-01 — `group:all` realtime topic + `hq_group_topic` policy.** One trigger replaces 12 simultaneous per-country subscriptions per HQ tab. Existing `hq_country_topic` policy (00008) stays — HQ retains the ability to subscribe to a specific `country:<code>` topic when drilling into a country page.
- **Plan 05-01 — RLS NOT tightened on the new HQ views.** Country admins can technically `SELECT * FROM group_today_stats` and get country-scoped sums (RLS hides their other-country leads). Route layer (`apps/web/app/(hq)/layout.tsx requireRole(['hq_admin'])`) is the access boundary, kept symmetrical with how `country_today_stats` works for HQ admin reads.

## Working tree status at last update

Clean. Untracked `.claude/` directory (local Claude Code config) and `excalidraw.log` only.

## Next move

**Plan 05-01 shipped.** Migration 00013 applied to `tgswsdfaszvztbpczfve`: 3 security_invoker views (`group_today_stats`, `country_performance_today`, `leads_by_service_group`), 1 hq_admin-only RPC (`group_speed_to_lead_series`), 1 broadcast trigger (`leads_broadcast_group` → `group:all`), 1 RLS policy (`hq_group_topic`). Database types regenerated. 8/8 vitest cases green, 3 flake-free runs. Type-check + lint clean.

Phase 4 remains shipped (`phase-4-complete` tag staged locally; push pending explicit user approval, same posture as `phase-2-complete` and `phase-3-complete`).

**Plan 05-02 — DAL + Zod + UI shell** is next. Surface to build per 05-01 SUMMARY's "Next Phase Readiness":
- `packages/supabase/src/dal/group.ts` — 4 query functions + Zod schemas + `computeResponseStatus(seconds)` helper
- `packages/supabase/src/realtime/use-group-broadcast.ts` — thin wrapper over `usePrivateBroadcast` with `topic: 'group:all', event: '*'`
- Promote `parseRangeParams` to `apps/web/app/_lib/date-range.ts` (Phase 5 is the third caller per 04-RESEARCH.md line 233)
- Wire `apps/web/app/(hq)/page.tsx` to render the KPI strip + leaderboard + leads-by-service + speed-to-lead trend, mirroring the country-admin shell.

Carry-overs explicitly tracked into Phase 6:
- Next.js 16 `middleware` → `proxy` rename (deprecation warning at every build).
- Hermetic vitest setup (route-driven tests still need `npm run dev` running on port 3012; full-suite runs hit Supabase auth rate-limit).
- `createServiceRoleClient` and `createAdminClient` convergence.
- Phase 1 `user_roles` policies wrapping for InitPlan caching symmetry — relevant now that 00012 has joined the file.
- Offset → cursor pagination on the lead list view (use `(created_at, id)` cursor pair to break ties).
- **From 04-04**: stat-tile component consolidation (3 patterns now exist: `MetricCard` full-width top bar, `queue-stats` ring, `kpi-strip` ring). Consolidate to one shared component.
- **From 04-04**: range-picker UI on country-admin overview (overview honours `?range=` URL contract today; URL-only acceptable for v1, picker is a small polish lift).
- **From 05-01**: explicit `REVOKE ALL ... FROM anon, authenticated` on the three `broadcast_lead_to_*` trigger functions; wrap `auth.jwt()` in `(SELECT ...)` for `hq_group_topic` and the other realtime.messages policies (InitPlan caching sweep).
